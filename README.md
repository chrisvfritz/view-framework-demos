# View framework demos

Super simple single-file (as in `index.html`) todo apps to judge the ease of getting start with various view libraries. That means:

- Just ES5 JavaScript (no Babel or other transpile-to-JS languages)
- no Webpack or other build tools

I tried to also include Angular 2, but it didn't seem to scale down far enough. If I missed something, please do submit a pull request.
