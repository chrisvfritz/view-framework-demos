## View framework demos

### Who?

I teach a lot of people who've never heard of Babel or Webpack. They've written a fair amount of JavaScript and have used some jQuery, though wouldn't consider themselves experts in either.

### What?

I want to introduce these people to a new view framework and wrote these quick demos to get a sense of how easy it would be to dip one's toes into any of them. I'm showing them to people and just asking, "As you look at this code, please think out loud."

I'm not looking to analyze factors such as popularity, documentation, or community - I'm just going for gut feel as people look at the code examples.

### Why?

jQuery is great, but it doesn't enforce any kind of structure or modularity, making it unideal for the more complex UIs that many want to build. Without having the experience or discipline of a more senior developer, it's easy for these projects to grow more and more unwieldy over time.
